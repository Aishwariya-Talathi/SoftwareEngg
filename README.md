Using the game instructions for Risk 2003, construct the following:
1.	A Use Case model for “Your Turn”. 
    The Your Turn instructions are about 4 pages long and contain multiple steps so it is broken into several use cases.
2.	A UML Class Diagram for the potential classes found in the Use Case Model. 
    The class diagram has operations and data for each class. 
    It also has proper connection to all classes.
3.	A Use Case Diagram for the Use Case Model.
